# CSCI-5454-Algorithms-Final-Project
Final project for CSCI-5454 Design and Analysis of Algorithms. Comparison of two algorithms for finding n-dimensional convex hulls - Quickhull and Divide &amp; Conquer.


In this repo:
 -  `quickhull.py` - Implementation of Quickhull algorithm in 2D and 3D
 -  `divide_and_conquer.py` - Implementation of Divide & Conquer algorithm in 2D and 3D
 -  `main.py` - Main file to run the algorithms and generate visualizations
 -  `visualize.py` - Functions for plotting the results in 2D and 3D, with interactive 3D plots
 -  `benchmark_2.py` - Functions for comparing performance of algorithms in 2D
